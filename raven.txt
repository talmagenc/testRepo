# The Raven
by Edgar Allan Poe

Once upon a midnight dreary as I ondered weak and weary
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore
While I nodded there came a tapping.
As of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.

Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor
Eagerly I wished the morrow--vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow-sorrow for the last Lenore
From that rare and radiant maiden who the angels named Lenore
Nameless here forevermore.
